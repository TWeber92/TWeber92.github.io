Because of my infatuation for technology and consumer electronics combined with a strong background in equipment and device repair, my interests have developed into a pursuit for an understanding of how it is all designed. Application development is imbedded in nearly every modern electronic device today. By grasping a full concept of the inner workings of software design I will feel accomplished knowing I have taken the first steps to reaching my goals. â€‹Now after a decade in the repair industry ive spent the last year migrating in a new direction, Fullstack Web Development. With my newly gained skills, I hope to find an opportunity that will support my ambition to continue to progress as an aspiring program developer.
